### **Image Gallery Description**

The **Image Gallery** is a visual collection of images that allows users to view, upload, and delete images. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing image files. 

Key Features:
- **Image Display**: All uploaded images are displayed in a neat, responsive grid layout, ensuring that images are presented in a visually appealing manner across different screen sizes.
- **Lightbox Functionality**: Users can click on any image to view it in a larger size, with easy navigation options to view the previous or next image. A darkened overlay appears to highlight the selected image.
- **Image Upload**: Users (or admins) can upload new images via a simple file upload form. Once uploaded, the images are automatically added to the gallery.
- **Image Deletion**: Admins have the ability to delete any image directly from the gallery. A password-protected login system ensures that only authorized users can manage the images.

### **How it works:**
1. **Viewing Images**: Users can scroll through the gallery, where each image is presented in a grid. Clicking on an image opens it in a full-screen view with navigation buttons to move between images.
2. **Uploading Images**: A form allows users to upload images, which are stored in a designated folder. The gallery automatically updates to show newly uploaded images.
3. **Deleting Images**: Admin users can access a deletion page where they are prompted to log in. Once logged in, the admin can choose which image to delete by clicking a "Delete" button next to each image.

This feature provides an intuitive and seamless experience for users to interact with and manage images in a personal or shared collection.
